# Cacheable Datasource: On Demand

This extension is created to be an add-on for the Cacheable Datasource extension. It will clear caches when entries are created, updated or deleted in the backend. It is stupidly simple and will blindly clear all `*.xml` files inside the `/manifest/cache/cacheabledatasource`.
